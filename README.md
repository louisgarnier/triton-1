# Triton

### TODO

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Coinbase Client | Add Coinbase REST Client |
| Bistamp Client | Add Bitstamp REST Client |
| Quandl Client | Add Bitstamp REST Client: https://docs.quandl.com/docs/python-installation
| Email Alert Module | Make a function in Utils.py that takes list of emails and some text as inputs, and send the text to these email addresses as output
| Asset tracker | New script in the root folder takes as input the a client list (list of clients where you own some assets) gets all these clients, gets you current positions and computes your profits (price bought - current price)
| Industries | Make list of all relevant companies and their tickers in the appropriate files in the industries folder
| Industry tracker | New script that gets all tickers in industry dir, gets their prices, and compute aggregate price per industry. Time span should be a param, as well as time aggregation (minute, hour, day, week, month). Goal is to be able to study the variations of an industry over time.
| Price variation | New script in root dir that outputs top 20 tickers with highest price variation in the past 24h (timespan should be a param)
| Price volatility| New script in root dir that outputs top 20 tickers with highest price volatility in the past 24h (timespan should be a param - this could be in the same script as above)
| Tests | Write tests for all scripts and clients

### Running `python 3.7.4`
Goal is to have all our code and datastores to in one single place for easy data analysis and tracking price evloution of different asset classes.

- `client` directory is where we get data from the different providers.
- `config` is where we hold the creds for connecting to the data providers
- `logs` is directory where we save our logs for debugging
- `industries` is dir that holds yaml files of "Company Name": "Stock Ticker" info.

### Setup
Fork this repo: https://github.com/Maxime93/triton.git, then you will have a copy of the codebase in your personal repo `username/triton`.
Then, from your fork of `triton`, clone on you local machine.

Install pyenv (python version management) to make sure we are all running the same python versions and dependencies: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#homebrew-on-macos (install with homebrew). `brew install pyenv`. If you don't have homebrew, install it before: https://brew.sh

Then install python 3.7.4: `pyenv install 3.7.4`
Then install pyenv-virtualenv: `brew install pyenv-virtualenv`.
Once the is complete you need to copy paste the two lines below in your terminal profile
```
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
```
You only have to do the above once (refer to doc https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv)

Then create your triton virtualenv: `pyenv virtualenv 3.7.4 triton`. Now before running any triton script on your machine, make sure to `pyenv activate triton` which activates the virtual env.

First time setting up the virtualenv? You need to install all the necessary libraries as such: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (make sure you are in the triton repo).

You now have a virtual environement where you can run our triton python 3.7 code on!

You need to set up your config files in the `configs` dir. Every user had different trading account connection credentials that are never pushed online.
For Alpaca.yml, structure is the below:
```
Alpaca:
  Live:
    base_route: https://api.alpaca.markets
    api_key: <your-api-key>
    secret_key: <your-secret-key>
  Paper:
    base_route: https://paper-api.alpaca.markets
    api_key: <your-api-key>
    secret_key: <your-secret-key>
```
Refer to the `README.md` doc in configs dir to know how to format configs for the different clients!

Now run `python Demo.py -t AAPL`, if you don't get an error you are good to go!

### Workflow

This is the required workflow when making changes to code, or adding features to the library. This assumes that you have forked the main repo, and cloned your fork to your local machine.

1. Make sure you have the correct remote repos set up:
`git remote -v` should output four lines:
--> Two origins, pointing to your fork
--> Two upstreams, pointing to https://github.com/Maxime93/triton.git
If you don't have the upstream: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/Maxime93/triton.git`

2. Fetch the latest code from upstream: `git fetch upstream master` & `git rebase upstream/master` to make sure you have the latest code localy.
3. Create a new branch `git checkout -b newFeature`.
4. Code your implementation.
5. Once done (and tested), push your new branch `newFeature` to your fork like such: `git push origin newFeature`
6. Submit a PR to the upstream repo (Maxime93/triton) in the github Website.
7. Once PR is merged, go back to your master branch `git checkout master` then do `git fetch upstream master` then `git rebase upstream/master`. A that point the code you developped on your local `NewFeature` branch has gone to your origin repo, pulled by the upstream repo, and pulled back to your local `master` branch.

Last step you can `git push origin master`, so the master branch from your repo has the latest code as well, and `git checkout -b NewFeature` delete that local branch that is now merged with you local master branch.

Congrats you now know how to use git.
